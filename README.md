# Ouroboros Closed Back Headphones

![20240310_103819](https://github.com/CapraAudio/Ouroboros/assets/122894651/e75926d7-b381-496a-a7c3-488ec568728b)

Ouroboros is a closed back headphone designed and intended for people who value high quality audio. With a dark-tilted tuning and a decent bass shelf these cans sound both fun and high fidelity.Â 

The ring-radiator driver (similar to the one on the legendary HD800 and HD800s) is the reason behind the name Ouroboros as when we first laid eyes on it we were reminded of the serpent eating its tail. Although the driver is sold as a "coaxial dual driver" speaker, we do not use the small beryllium tweeter as a speaker, instead we de-solder the connections to it and allow it to operate as a passive radiator between the front and rear volumes.

This model is set to [Creative Commons - Attribution - Noncommercial - NoDerivatives] because it is designed purposefully, any changes to the design by anyone other than Capra Audio would no longer be the Ouroboros. This includes using the wrong speakers, wrong pads, or missing or wrong front/rear damping materials. The Ouroboros is the complete unit itself. It is hard to design and tune a headphone to be good and we do not want our name associated with a potentially worse version of our design.
